# Computational-Physics-Project

The study focuses on a binary star system consisting of two stars: one with 50% of the Sun’s mass and another equal in mass to the Sun. This binary system has an orbital period of 30 Earth days. The objective is to determine where a planet could maintain a stable orbit within this system and to describe the possible stable planetary trajectories.

To address this problem, simulations will be implemented in Python, starting with the well-understood Earth-Sun system as a baseline. Gradually, the complexity will increase, incorporating a second star to analyze the gravitational dynamics of a binary system. The simulations will explore different orbital configurations, considering factors such as the planet’s semi-major axis, eccentricity, and resonance conditions.

Through numerical integration techniques and stability criteria, the study aims to determine safe zones where a planet can maintain a long-term stable orbit without being ejected or colliding with one of the stars.
